            <p>As part of our funding commitments, National Science Foundation (NSF) funded projects, such as CAP LTER, are required to make as much research data as possible publicly available. The CAP LTER project adheres to the LTER data access policy and aims to publish all research data unless limited by either privacy or license restrictions.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to data access includes the provision of metadata to enable data users to assess the content and significance of the data they download.</p>
